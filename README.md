# React Tour with MongoDB Integration

This is a React application that integrates **React Shepherd** to guide users through an interactive tour. The tour steps are pulled from a **MongoDB** database, and user progress is tracked using **localStorage** to ensure only new steps are shown to returning users. The project also provides functionality for the **Project Manager** to upload, manage, and download the tour steps using **Excel files**.

## Features:
- Interactive, step-by-step tour using **React Shepherd**.
- **MongoDB** integration for storing and retrieving tour steps and user progress.
- **Excel file upload** to allow the Project Manager to manage the tour steps.
- Tracks user progress in **localStorage** and displays only new steps to returning users.
- Project Manager can download the current tour steps into an **Excel file**.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd your-repository-name
npm install
```

### 3. Configure MongoDB

Ensure MongoDB is set up and running. You can use a local MongoDB instance or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB URI:

```
REACT_APP_MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
```

### 4. Run the Application

Start the application in development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Project Manager Features

To override the background color of the **title section** in **React Shepherd**, it's important to ensure that you're targeting the correct classes or elements in the CSS and applying your styles correctly.

React Shepherd is built on top of the Shepherd.js library, which uses default styles that might not be immediately responsive to simple class overrides. You'll likely need to use more specific selectors or even use `!important` to enforce your styles.

Here are the steps and a few possible solutions to solve this issue:

### 1. **Inspect the Title Section**
   Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the title section of a Shepherd step. Typically, the title section will have a specific class that you can target, such as `.shepherd-header`, `.shepherd-title`, or similar.

   For example, you can inspect the DOM and check if the title is contained within an element like:
   ```html
   <div class="shepherd-header">
       <h2 class="shepherd-title">Step Title</h2>
   </div>
   ```

### 2. **Custom CSS to Override Title Background**
   After identifying the element, you can then write the CSS to override the background color. Here’s how you can do it:

#### Example 1: Overriding Background Color for Title Section

```css
/* Override the Shepherd step title section */
.shepherd-header {
    background-color: #1f88e5 !important;  /* Your desired background color */
    color: white;                          /* Change text color to ensure it contrasts well */
}

/* Optionally, change the title text color */
.shepherd-title {
    color: white !important;
}
```

This will change the background color of the **title** section in the Shepherd step.

### 3. **Targeting More Specific Elements**

If `.shepherd-header` is not the correct class, or if the styles are still not applying as expected, you can make the CSS more specific by chaining the selectors.

#### Example 2: Using More Specific CSS Selectors

```css
/* Target only shepherd steps */
.shepherd-step-container .shepherd-header {
    background-color: #0070f3 !important;
    color: white !important;
}

.shepherd-step-container .shepherd-title {
    color: white !important;
}
```

Here, we are targeting the `.shepherd-header` specifically inside the `.shepherd-step-container` to ensure that only the steps' title background is affected.

### 4. **Ensure CSS is Loaded Correctly**
   Ensure that your CSS is being imported into your React app properly. In case you're using an external CSS file (e.g., `tour-styles.css`), you should import it in your React component:

```tsx
import './tour-styles.css';  // Path to your custom CSS file
```

### 5. **Alternative Solution: Inline Styles**
If CSS overrides are still not working or if you're looking for a more direct approach, you can use inline styles in the `renderStep` function to apply styles dynamically.

#### Example 3: Using Inline Styles in the `renderStep` Method

```tsx
const tour = new Shepherd.Tour({
  steps: [
    {
      id: 'step-1',
      text: 'Welcome to the first step!',
      attachTo: { element: '.my-element', on: 'bottom' },
      buttons: [
        {
          text: 'Next',
          action: () => tour.next(),
        },
      ],
      renderStep: (step) => (
        <div style={{ backgroundColor: '#1f88e5', color: 'white', padding: '20px' }}>
          <h2>{step.text}</h2>
          <button onClick={() => step.next()} style={{ backgroundColor: '#0070f3', color: 'white', padding: '10px' }}>
            Next
          </button>
        </div>
      ),
    },
  ],
});
```

This approach gives you full control over the styling of the step, including the title section and buttons.

### 6. **Use CSS Modules (If Using Them)**
If you're using CSS Modules in your project, ensure that you're targeting the right class names generated by the CSS Modules compiler. You would import the styles like so:

```tsx
import styles from './tour.module.css';

// Then use styles as:
<div className={styles.shepherdHeader}>
  <h2>{step.text}</h2>
</div>
```

Make sure your class names are scoped to avoid conflicts.

### Final Notes:
- **Ensure Proper Specificity**: When overriding CSS, you may need to increase the specificity of your selectors (e.g., by chaining multiple classes).
- **Use `!important`**: In case the default styles are overriding yours, adding `!important` will force your styles to take priority.
- **Inline Styles**: If all else fails, using inline styles within the `renderStep` function can guarantee full control over the step content, including background colors and text styles.

Preparing a demo where your **React Shepherd** tour features shine without feeling "messy" is all about **clarity**, **structure**, and a **smooth flow** that highlights each feature with clear context. Here’s a step-by-step strategy on how to organize your demo effectively:

### 1. **Plan the Structure of the Demo**
   A great demo has a clear **beginning**, **middle**, and **end**. Focus on the flow of your features in a logical order, showcasing one feature at a time, building on top of the last. Here's how you can break it down:

### 2. **Start with an Introduction**
   - **Brief Introduction** (1-2 mins): 
     - Explain what the tour is and its use case. Mention that the tour will guide users through steps of an app (or whatever your use case is), and emphasize how it's designed to improve user experience.
     - **What you're going to show**: Mention that you'll be demonstrating how data can be downloaded from MongoDB, how to generate the tour steps dynamically, how to retrieve the data as an Excel file, and how to upload an Excel file to generate steps.

   **Tip**: Keep the introduction brief but focused on setting expectations. Use clear, simple language.

### 3. **Feature Walkthrough**

#### **Feature 1: Download Steps from MongoDB and Generate the Tour**
   - **Context**: Explain that the steps for the tour are being dynamically fetched from MongoDB.
   - **What to do**:
     1. **Click a "Load Tour" Button** or a similar action that loads the steps.
     2. Walk through **MongoDB** (show the document or collection) briefly so the client can see where the data comes from.
     3. Generate the steps for the **Shepherd Tour**.
     4. Demonstrate that the tour starts automatically and goes through the steps (as intended).

   **Tip**: Avoid showing any backend code or server details. Keep it focused on the end result. 

#### **Feature 2: Retrieving and Downloading as Excel**
   - **Context**: Explain that the user can **export the generated steps** to Excel for future reference or further manipulation.
   - **What to do**:
     1. Click a **Download Excel** button to export the data.
     2. Show that an **Excel file is downloaded**.
     3. Open the Excel file to show how the steps are organized neatly in a tabular format (you can quickly open the file or show the content briefly to confirm).

   **Tip**: **Simplify the export process** in the demo so the client doesn't see unnecessary loading or error messages.

#### **Feature 3: Upload Excel and Regenerate Steps**
   - **Context**: Explain that users can **upload an Excel file** to regenerate the steps based on the file.
   - **What to do**:
     1. Click **Upload Excel** and select a pre-made Excel file (this could be a mock file with a few sample steps).
     2. The system reads the Excel data and **regenerates the steps**.
     3. Trigger the **Shepherd Tour** again, showing that the tour steps have changed based on the uploaded file.

   **Tip**: Ensure the **upload process is seamless** and doesn’t involve too much waiting. If possible, pre-upload a test file or show the process without having to manually select a file.

### 4. **Key Tips for Keeping the Demo Clean and Impressive**
   - **Preload Data**: Make sure the data in MongoDB and the sample Excel file are already prepared and don’t require manual setup during the demo. This avoids unnecessary waiting and potential errors.
   - **Focus on the User Experience**: Ensure the flow feels smooth, with **clear transitions** between actions. You want the audience to feel that it’s easy to download/upload and generate tours, not like they’re dealing with complicated processes.
   - **Avoid Technical Jargon**: Don’t go too deep into backend or coding details unless your client is technically inclined. Keep it focused on **how the features benefit them**.
   - **Keep it Simple**: Only showcase the most critical aspects of each feature. Don't overcomplicate things with too many options or configurations.
   - **Show Before and After**: When uploading an Excel file, it helps to show the **before** (empty or default steps) and the **after** (updated tour steps) to emphasize the flexibility of the system.
   - **Highlight Key Features**: Focus on the **ease of use** and the **automation** of the process, especially how the system saves time and effort for the client. 
   
### 5. **Maintain Visual Clarity**
   - **Organize Your UI**: Make sure your app’s UI looks clean, with clearly labeled buttons, easy navigation, and visible progress indicators (for loading or processing).
   - **Simple and Intuitive Design**: Avoid unnecessary elements on the page while you demo, and focus on the functionality at hand. This minimizes distractions and keeps the client’s attention on the core features.
   - **Use the Shepherd Tour** to guide through the demo. Make sure the tour is **clear and easy to follow** (i.e., the steps are well-defined, with no clutter). You can even customize the text within the Shepherd tour to explain what the client is looking at.

### 6. **Focus on the Business Value**
   - **Time-Saving**: Emphasize how the system **automates the creation of the tour steps** from MongoDB or Excel files, saving time on manual setup.
   - **Flexibility**: Showcase the **flexibility of managing tours**, whether it's exporting steps to Excel for future updates or uploading new steps via Excel.
   - **User Experience**: Highlight how this system improves the **user experience** by guiding users through the app in a structured and visually appealing way.

### 7. **Wrap It Up with a Clear Summary**
   - **Summarize** the key features you’ve demonstrated.
   - **Recap** the main benefits, focusing on **efficiency**, **automation**, and **user-friendliness**.
   - **Invite questions**: End by saying something like, "I’d be happy to answer any questions or dive deeper into any of these features."

### 8. **Prepare for Questions**
   - Be ready to address any questions or concerns your client might have about the system’s scalability, ease of use, or integration with other tools.
